# Custom Encryptor and Decryptor
## Description
This is a simple program that uses a custom logic ( just bitwise shift in unicode ) to encrypt the files.
It mostly helped me to understand file manipulation in java and how `FileWriter` and `Scanner` work.

## Example
```
Clear Text : hello there
Cypher Text : ƠƔưưƼ ǐƠƔǈƔ
```
Some unicode characters might not show due to the encoding format.
